            <p class="about-text">
                BotaniQ was born out of a vision to elevate vegan dining beyond just an alternative—it’s an art form.
                <br>BotaniQ first started on a food truck, starting from humble roots before climbing in notoriety and soon reaching out to a separate market:  fine dining.
                <br>Since opening, BotaniQ has been a gathering place for food lovers, professionals, and conscious diners alike—offering a menu that proves vegan cuisine can be just as refined, intricate, and satisfying as any gourmet experience, while maintaining affordability as connection to their roots.
