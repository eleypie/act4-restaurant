        <h2>How it all began</h2>
        <p>
            BotaniQ was born out of a vision to elevate vegan dining beyond just an alternative—it’s an art form. Our founder, a former fine-dining chef, traveled through Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, inspired by the depth of flavors in plant-forward Southeast Asian cuisine. Seeing an opportunity to merge professional culinary techniques with sustainable dining, they created BotaniQ: a space where plant-based food is not just healthy, but bold, exciting, and exquisitely crafted.<br><br>
            Since opening, BotaniQ has been a gathering place for food lovers, professionals, and conscious diners alike—offering a menu that proves vegan cuisine can be just as refined, intricate, and satisfying as any gourmet experience.
